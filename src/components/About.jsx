              <br />
              üöÄ With experience as a Software Engineer at Boomi, an R&D intern at Genpact, and an SDE intern
              at PHN Technology, I've honed my skills in a wide range of
              technologies. At Boomi, I designed and implemented AI Agents in Amazon Bedrock using Lambda Functions and KnowledgeBase with S3 as a datasource, enhancing automation capabilities with Guardrails. I automated AWS workflows using Python (Boto3), created scalable CloudFormation templates, and contributed to front-end microservices using React.js and Next.js, achieving 100% Jest test coverage. Additionally, I mentored interns, improving team productivity and project handoffs.
              <br />
              <br />
              My expertise spans HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, FastAPI, Langchain, RAG Pipeline, Docker, Nginx, Azure OpenAI, MySQL, MongoDB, and AWS services like Lambda, S3, CloudFormation, and EventBridge. From building AI-driven solutions to automating complex workflows, I thrive on tackling challenges and delivering impactful projects.
              <br />
              <br />
              ‚úçÔ∏è Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and gaming. I'm always eager to learn and share my insights. My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology and create solutions that make a difference.
